# ChatApp
Test chat application in AngularJS

Since I have developed this application on Ubuntu, I've been using Python SimpleHTTPServer for running it localy.

To do that, navigate to app folder and run command in terminal : "python -m SimpleHTTPServer"

Many browsers on various operating systems have problem with CORS by default, except Firefox, using run/terminal commands should help.


Chrome on Windows :

"chrome.exe --allow-file-access-from-files"



Chrome and Chromium under Linux :

"chrome --allow-file-access-from-files"

"chromium-browser --allow-file-access-from-files"
